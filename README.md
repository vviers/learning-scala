# `Scala Pokerhand App`

My very first attempt at programming in Scala. Mostly keeping this here as a note-to-self.

- `poker_hand.scala` creates the poker hand class
- `poker_game.scala` creates an object derived from App (no need for a `main()` function) that lets you "play" cards from the terminal.
- Disregard `hello_world.scala`
----

## To run the app:
* Compile `poker_hand.scala`and `poker_game.scala`:
```
scalac poker_hand.scala
scalac poker_game.scala
```
* run the program
```
scala -cp . pokergame.poker_game
```

To kill the app, simply press `^C`
